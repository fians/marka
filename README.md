# Marka

Marka is transform-able icon set, beautifully and carefully designed to work on the web. View a demo and read the documentation on http://fian.my.id/marka.

## Documentation

Marka uses [Situs](https://github.com/fians/situs) to generate the docs. 
Here are some steps to build the documentation locally on your computer:

1. Make sure Node.js and npm are installed on your computer. If they're not, just get the installer [here](http://nodejs.org/).
2. Install Situs globally via npm (`npm install situs -g`).
3. Clone the GitHub repository (`git clone https://github.com/fians/marka.git`).
4. Go to the Marka directory and just start the Situs server (`situs server`).
5. Then visit [http://localhost:4000/](http://localhost:4000/) on your browser.

## Development
Marka's master branch only contains v0.3.*. For the next version of Marka (v0.4.0) please see [v0.4.0-dev branch](https://github.com/fians/marka/tree/v0.4.0-dev).
